Hello! My name is Akash Sunar, and I am from Kawasoti, Nawalpur, but currently reside in Pokhara. I am about to complete my Bachelor's degree in Electronics, Communication, and Information Engineering from the Institute of Engineering, Paschimanchal Campus. I have immense interest in web development, software development, and UI/UX design and have chosen the Tej Fellowship to begin my software engineering journey. During my engineering studies, I have worked on few team projects and have gained valuable experience. I am eager to continue learning and growing in the technical field. In my free time, I enjoy listening to music, writing poems, and exploring other interesting things. I also love to interact and have fun with my friends.
