My name is Hemlal Dulal, and I am from Melamchi, Sindhupalchok. I am currently in my 8th semester, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Information Technology (BSc.CSIT) at Patan Multiple Campus.

During my professional journey, I had the privilege of working with Matrix Sub-Tech Pvt. Ltd, where I gained valuable experience in software development. Additionally, I took training in MERN stack technology through Deerwalk Training Center, further enhancing my skills and knowledge in web development.

I am deeply passionate about software development and enjoy the process of creating new software solutions. I firmly believe that software can simplify tasks and make them more efficient, requiring less effort. I approach problem-solving by analyzing the issues at hand and applying the optimal methods using the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

Throughout my academic journey, I have gained proficiency in several programming languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, and Python. These languages have not only been a part of my syllabus but also a personal interest, allowing me to explore and expand my programming capabilities.

Outside my academic and professional pursuits, I have diverse interests. I enjoy traveling to new places as it refreshes me and exposes me to different cultures and perspectives. Football is another passion of mine which I actively participate in. Additionally, I find solace in reading books, as they provide me with knowledge and inspiration.

Furthermore, I am honored to be in the 5th cohort of the Samaanta Foundation Fellowship, an organization dedicated to making a positive impact on society. I have a strong desire to contribute my skills and knowledge to society on various occasions and projects.

Overall, I am a dedicated and enthusiastic individual with a genuine passion for software development. I constantly seek opportunities to learn and grow, with a strong belief in the power of technology to shape a better future.
