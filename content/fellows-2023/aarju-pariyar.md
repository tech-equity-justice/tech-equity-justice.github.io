I am Aarju Pariyar, currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Business Studies from Sukuna Multiple Campus, Tribhuvan University. I am interested in technology and have recently discovered a passion for programming. Despite not having a technical background, I aspire to become a skilled Software Engineer.
Apart from programming, I enjoy cooking, learning new recipes, and listening to music. I am also fond of traveling and exploring new places.
