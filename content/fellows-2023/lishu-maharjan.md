My name is Lishu Maharjan, and I'm from Bhimsensthan, Kathmandu. At Prime College, I am now pursuing a Bachelor of Information Management (BIM) degree. Since I was little, I have had a strong interest in world history, music, nature exploration, and learning new things. I've always been interested in a career in IT, despite not having held any IT-related employment. I was able to learn useful programming skills over the course of four years, and I'm now trying to concentrate on becoming a Software Developer.
