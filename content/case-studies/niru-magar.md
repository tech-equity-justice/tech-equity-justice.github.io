Niru Kumari Magar, from a lower-middle-class family in Siraha, Nepal, always dreamed of pursuing higher education despite financial struggles. Her father, a firefighter, worked hard to support the family, while her mother, a 10th-grade graduate, strongly believed in education for girls. With their encouragement, Niru completed her schooling from government institutions and earned her master’s degree in Zoology from Tribhuvan University. After graduation, she began working as a teacher. However, her teaching career felt stagnant—both professionally and financially limiting. She longed for growth and sought new challenges, especially in the field of technology.<br/><br/>
When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, Niru was left jobless but remained determined to enter the tech world. Despite her interest, learning coding on her own was overwhelming. The lack of structured guidance led to self-doubt, and she nearly gave up, questioning whether she had what it took to succeed in the tech industry.<br/><br/>
A turning point came when a friend introduced Niru to the TEJ Fellowship, which offered the structured learning she needed. It promised not only technical skills but also soft skills training and a stipend—exactly the opportunity she had been seeking.
Initially, Niru struggled with coding, particularly understanding functions and articulating her challenges. However, with the constant support of TEJ mentors and peers, she persevered through these difficulties. With practice and patience, she learned to break down complex problems, explain them clearly, and improve her coding skills.<br/><br/>
Mentorship at TEJ extended beyond technical training. Niru’s mentors guided her in personal development, teaching her how to write professional emails, speak confidently, and present herself in formal settings. This holistic guidance shaped her as a leader and communicator, adding invaluable skills to her tech journey.<br/><br/>
The TEJ Fellowship transformed Niru’s career. What began as a fellowship has come full circle—she is now a full-time Teaching Fellow at TEJ. Her inspiring journey, from struggling with coding to teaching others, exemplifies her perseverance and newfound confidence.
