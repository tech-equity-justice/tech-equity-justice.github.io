Raju Lama, a TEJ 2022 Fellow from a middle-class family in Nepal, always had a passion for technology but was forced to pursue an Arts degree due to financial constraints. Despite teaching himself programming, Raju struggled to gain entry into the IT industry without a tech degree and faced frequent rejections from internships.<br/><br/>
Raju’s breakthrough came when he discovered the TEJ Fellowship on Facebook. The program’s focus on providing opportunities for socially marginalized individuals resonated with him, and he was accepted into the fellowship. Determined to improve his programming skills and establish himself as a software developer, Raju embraced the fellowship’s holistic approach to learning.<br/><br/>
Despite facing societal biases and a speech impairment, the mentorship and structured learning at TEJ empowered Raju to overcome his challenges. The fellowship honed his problem-solving abilities and coding expertise, leading to his current role as a software engineer at a prestigious IT company.<br/><br/>
Raju credits TEJ Fellowship for transforming his career and life. His advice to future fellows is to stay dedicated, as the fellowship not only builds technical skills but also fosters personal growth, helping individuals turn their challenges into strengths.
