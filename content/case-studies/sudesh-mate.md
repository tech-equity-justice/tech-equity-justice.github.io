Sudesh Mate, from Biratchowk, Morang, comes from a middle-class Dalit family of nine, including his parents and six sisters. Raised in modest circumstances, with his father working as a tailor, Mate completed a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from IOE, Purwanchal Campus.
Before joining the TEJ Fellowship, Mate's learning was self-driven but unstructured, often leading to confusion and slow progress. He also struggled with public speaking, lacking confidence in presenting ideas. During his undergraduate years, he attempted to build an e-commerce website but faced frequent roadblocks due to the lack of proper guidance.<br/><br/>
The turning point came when a friend introduced him to the TEJ Fellowship. Nearing final exams, Mate saw this as a golden opportunity to learn software engineering and essential soft skills, along with the benefit of a stipend.<br/><br/>
During the fellowship, Mate focused on strengthening programming fundamentals, improving problem-solving skills, and mastering presentation techniques. One major challenge was overcoming his use of filler words during presentations. With mentorship and practice, his confidence grew, and his presentation skills improved significantly.<br/><br/>
Mentorship at TEJ was pivotal. "Mentors provided a structured learning path, offered immediate assistance, and guided me in both technical and personal growth," Mate shared. Daily icebreakers and problem-solving sessions sharpened his analytical skills and boosted his confidence.
The TEJ Fellowship was transformative for Mate. It led to his first job as a software engineer at Rhombuz.io and shaped his career path.
