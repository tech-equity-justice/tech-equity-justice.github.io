He always felt the lack of good mentorship and guidance throughout his academic and professional career and feels strongly about solving it for the younger generation of students and professionals. That’s one big reason he started <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://HamroGroup.org">HamroGroup.org</a>.
