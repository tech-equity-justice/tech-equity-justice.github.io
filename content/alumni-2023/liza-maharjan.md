I am Liza Maharjan from Lagantole, Kathmandu, a current student at Prime College pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Information Management (BIM). With a passion for designing, music, and coding, I have always been interested in exploring new ideas and creating solutions to tackle social issues. In my free time, I enjoy hiking and trekking to explore the beautiful landscapes of my home country. Through my work and hobbies, I am dedicated to making a positive impact in my community and beyond.
