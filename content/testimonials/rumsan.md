On behalf of Rumsan, we are pleased to commend the TEJ Foundation for its exceptional Fellowship program. TEJ Foundation’s training equips individuals from diverse backgrounds, even those outside of IT, with the skills needed to excel in software programming.
We have hired TEJ Fellows at Rumsan, and they have proven to be hardworking, quick learners, and highly collaborative. Within weeks, they have become productive members of our team, showing persistence in solving problems and contributing significantly to our projects.
We are grateful for TEJ Foundation’s work and look forward to continuing this valuable partnership.
