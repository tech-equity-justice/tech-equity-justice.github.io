Last year, we hired a group of trainees for on-the-job training with the goal of eventually placing them in various projects. From the very beginning, it was evident that the individuals we hired from the TEJ Fellowship program were not only technically proficient but also exceptional in their problem-solving abilities and communication skills. During the meetings, they consistently asked the right questions, demonstrating their eagerness to learn and understand. It's no surprise that most of them have already been placed in key projects and have received high praise from relevant stakeholders in their respective projects. They are now an integral part of our team.
