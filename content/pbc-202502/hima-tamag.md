Hima Tamang, originally from Bhumlu-8, Kavrepalanchok, now resides in Lazimpat, Kathmandu. She is currently pursuing a Master's degree in Clinical Psychology and diligently working on her thesis.
She has a deep love for learning new things, regardless of the subject. Beyond academics, she enjoys hiking and trekking and she is passionate about advocating for climate change and girls' education.
Her ultimate goal is to make a positive impact on society and give back to the community. A fun fact about her is that she tends to panic before trying anything new, but she always finds a way to get things done!
