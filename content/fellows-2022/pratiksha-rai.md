Originally from Janakpur, Pratiksha Rai has a Bachelors of Arts degree from Trichandra College. Her professional career up to this point has been in the NGO sector. She has always been interested in programming, but felt that her non-technical background and lack of guidance would pose a challenge to her entry into the field of Software Engineering. But with her selection as a TEJ Fellow, she is proving that it is a definite possibility! Besides coding, she is interested in understanding human development, behavior, social, economic, and cultural institutions.
