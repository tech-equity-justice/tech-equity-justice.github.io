            <p className="region-tn body2">
              Technology for Equity and Justice (TEJ), a US based organization,
              has developed a nine month coding fellowship for students from
              marginalized and underrepresented communities. The fellows will be
              trained from little or no coding knowledge to fully capable
              software engineers earning competitive salaries. Fellows will be
              paid a stipend of Rs. 15,000.00 a month throughout the program.
            </p>
            <p className="region-tn body2">
              The TEJ Fellows are selected following a rigorous selection
              process. The nine month fellowship is conducted in two phases: I)
              The Software Engineering Bootcamp phase is an in-house six-month
              full time bootcamp training program teaching javascript language
              frontend and backend skills. The training is facilitated by highly
              experienced IT Engineers with work experience in the United States
              and Nepal. II) The internship phase is focused on putting
              technical training to practical use. It includes soft skills
              training in communications and job search skills to find and grow
              in good jobs in Nepal and international companies.

            <p className="h5">WHY TEJ?</p>
            <p className="region-tn body2">
              The technology industry has constantly faced a shortage of good
              software engineers. As the supply of computer engineering
              graduates has not been able to meet the demand, the last 10 years
              has seen the emergence of coding bootcamps in North America and
              Europe that are conducted in terms of six months or less. The
              bootcamp has proven to be a successful model, and employers now
              recruit from them just as they do from universities. These coding
              bootcamps provide unmatched return on investment as they prepare
              students for jobs in a short period.
            </p>
            <p className="region-tn body2">
              In Nepal, the representation of historically marginalized
              communities in the technology sector has been dramatically lower
              than those from privileged class and caste groups due to
              structural barriers, including a lack of access to information and
              resources. To address this issue and close the gap, TEJ has
              created a nine month coding fellowship designed to ensure the
              success of students from underrepresented groups and communities.
