              Technology for Equity and Justice (TEJ) has developed a nine-month
              coding fellowship for students from marginalized and
              underrepresented communities. The fellows will be trained from
              little or no coding knowledge to fully capable software engineers
              earning competitive salaries. Fellows will be paid a stipend of
              Rs. 16,000.00 a month throughout the program.

              The TEJ Fellows are selected following a rigorous selection
              process. The nine month fellowship is conducted in two phases: I)
              The Coding Bootcamp phase is an in-person six-month full-time
              training where we teach JavaScript language for frontend and
              backend. The training is facilitated by highly experienced IT
              Engineers with work experience in the United States and Nepal. II)
              The Internship phase is focused on putting technical training to
              practical use. It includes soft skills training in communications
              and job search skills to find and grow in good jobs in Nepali and
              international companies.

              At TEJ, recognizing the gender disparity in the technology sector
              and learning from our own experience in difficulties faced by
              women in learning technology, we have designed a three-month
              part-time Introduction to JavaScript Pre Bootcamp specifically for
              women from marginalized and underrepresented communities. This is
              a free program with five hours per week in-class, and an
              additional commitment of 10-15hrs per week to do the workshops and
              exercises. The fellows will be trained from little or no coding
              experience to a having solid foundation in programming
              fundamentals with a focus on JavaScript.

              The pre-bootcamp fellows are selected through an application
              process. The program has a weekly rhythm, where we introduce a new
              programming concept each week that builds on previous weeks'
              lessons. The knowledge is further explored by doing the assigned
              exercises, with additional help provided via an online community
              and office hours.
